== APING iOS Client ==

This package includes a library for interacting with the Betfair APING.

== Usage ==

The sample application code must be modified to include your own APING application key before it can be run.

An application key can be requested from https://api.developer.betfair.com/services/webapps/docs/display/1smk3cen4v3lu3yomq5qye0ni/Getting+Started+with+API-NG
